# neow3j Examples

This repository contains Jav examples for [neow3j](https://github.com/neow3j/neow3j). Its goal is
to give you a better understanding on how to use neow3j to develop dApps and smart contracts for 
Neo.

The directory *neo-n3-examples* contains examples for Neo N3 and *neo-legacy-exmaples* contains
examples for Neo Legacy. More information about the examples can be found inside the directories.


## Requirements

The examples require at least Java 8. 

Additionally, many examples will require a Neo network. We
recommend using [*Neo Express*](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express) for that purpose. It
is integrated into the [*Neo Blockchain Toolkit*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-blockchain-toolkit)
that is available on the VSCode Extension Marketplace. 

All example projects are using the [*Gradle*](https://gradle.org/) build tool and provide a
Gradle wrapper. So, you don't necessarily need Gradle installed on your machine.
