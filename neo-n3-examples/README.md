examples. You can then make use of the [*Neo Blockchain Toolkit*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-blockchain-toolkit)
which gives you the best developer experience with Neo.

These examples are accompanied by code tours. To make use of them install the VSCode [*Code
