# NeoFS Examples

> The `io.neow3j.neofs` package is not yet productive and currently only supported in a `SNAPSHOT` version.

The examples in this package provide some guidelines to get started with NeoFS in neow3j. Run the example
`CreateContainer` first to set up a container on NeoFS (testnet). The provided account (`ALICE`) has been prefunded on
testnet, so you can get started right away.

> If the ALICE account doesn't have enough funds any longer, you can send some `GAS` to the NeoFS contract that has 
> the address `NZAUkYbJ1Cb2HrNmwZ1pg9xYHBhm2FgtKV` (it's stored in `Constants.NEOFS_CONTRACT_TESTNET`).
