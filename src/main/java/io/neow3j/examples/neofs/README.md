# NeoFS Examples

> The `io.neow3j.neofs` package is not yet productive and currently only supported in a `SNAPSHOT` version.

The examples in this package provide some guidelines to get started with NeoFS in neow3j. Run the example 
`CreateContainer` first to set up a container on NeoFS (testnet). The provided account (`ALICE`) has been prefunded on 
testnet, so you can get started right away.
